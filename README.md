I am a graduate computer science student at Bonn, Germany and a research assistant at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS)](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/en.html). My primary interest is machine learning, with a focus on neural networks. I am currently writing my master thesis on recurrent neural networks for modeling radiological language.

I am about to finish my master thesis. Title: _Language Modeling with Recurrent Neural Networks - Using Transfer Learning to Perform Radiological Sentence Completion_

Abstract:

Motivated by the potential benefits of a system that accelerates the process of writing radiological reports, we present a Recurrent Neural Network Language Model for modeling radiological language. We show that Recurrent Neural Network Language Models can be used to produce convincing radiological reports and investigate how their performance can be improved by using advanced regularization techniques like embedding dropout or weight tying, and advanced initialization techniques like pre-trained word embeddings. Furthermore, we study the use of transfer learning to create topic-specific language models. To test the applicability of our techniques to other domains we perform experiments on a second dataset, consisting of forum posts on motorized vehicles. In addition to our experiments on Recurrent Neural Network Language Models, we train a Continuous Bag-of-Words model on the radiological dataset and analyze the resulting medical word embeddings. We show that the embeddings
encode medical relationships, semantic similarities and that certain medical relationships can be represented as linear translations.

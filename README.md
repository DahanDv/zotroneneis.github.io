I am a graduate computer science student at Bonn, Germany and a research assistant at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS)](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/en.html). My primary interest is machine learning, with a focus on neural networks. I am currently writing my master thesis on recurrent neural networks for modeling radiological language.


## News

I have recently finished my master thesis. In May 2018 I will move to Palo Alto, CA, USA to join Robert Bosch for an internship.

Starting September 2018 I will be one of the first residents of the Microsoft AI Residency Program in Cambridge, UK.

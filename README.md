## About (last updated July 20, 2018).

![](small_pic.png)

I am a computer science graduate, currently interning at Bosch in Palo Alto, California, USA. My primary interest is machine learning/deep learning, with a focus on neural networks. I am especially interested in the application of machine learning and deep learning in health care.


## News

I am currently working as a deep learning intern at Robert Bosch in Palo Alto, CA, USA. 

Starting September 2018 I will be one of the first residents of the Microsoft AI Residency Program in Cambridge, UK.

On July 23rd 2018 I started working on a new habit (for details see [my blog post](http://www.alpopkes.com/posts/2018/07/blog-post-1)), namely coding for at least 15 minutes a say. The major goal of this new habit was (and still is) to continously improve my coding skills. All the code I produce(d) during the challenge can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/zotroneneis/100_days_of_code). During the challenge, I worked on several important Python concepts, including:

- Object oriented programming
- Inheritance
- The proper usage of instance methods, class methods and static methods
- Decorators
- The @property decorator and property() function
- Function annotations
- etc.

On July 23rd 2018 I started working on a new habit (for details see [my blog post](http://www.alpopkes.com/posts/2018/07/blog-post-1)), namely coding for at least 15 minutes a day. The major goal of this new habit was (and still is) to continously improve my coding skills.

As part of the habit I've started creating a series of **blog posts** on important and awesome **Python features**, including object oriented programming, properties, function annotations, duck typing, etc.

Since I was bored by the usual tutorial examples, I looked for a topic that would make it fun to study and implement the concepts. And since I absolutely love Harry Potter, I started creating a whole Harry Potter universe around the topics. 

All code can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/zotroneneis/harry_potter_universe). My blog features the corresponding blog posts.

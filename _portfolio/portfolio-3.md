The main part of this project is based on exploring the ability of different recurrent Long Short-Term Memory architectures to generate novel monophonic melodies. All details about this part of the project can be found in the corresponding report.
   
In addition, we trained and tested a variational autoencoder on the same task.
   
All code is written in Python and uses TensorFlow.
   
The full project description and code can be found on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/zotroneneis/deep_music).

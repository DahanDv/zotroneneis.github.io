excerpt: "Plain Python implementations of basic machine learning algorithms"
collection: portfolio
---

I started this project when preparing for interviews and applying for different internships and residency programs. 

The project includes implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in plain Python (Python Version 3.6+). All algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries. The intention of the notebooks is to provide a basic understanding of the algorithms and their underlying structure. Therefore, each notebook also includes theoretical explanations about the algorithms and the most important formulas.

After receiving a lot of positive feedback on reddit ([click for post1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/83ohd5/p_basic_machine_learning_algorithms_in_plain/), [click for post2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/83p1t1/basic_machine_learning_algorithms_in_plain_python/)) and requests for a series on data preprocessing, I started notebooks on how to prepare datasets for machine learning algorithms. The notebooks are included in the same github repoistory.

The full project description and code can be found on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/zotroneneis/ml_basics).

Currently, the repo includes the following algorithms:   
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Perceptron
- k-nearest-neighbor
- k-Means clustering
- Simple neural network with one hidden layer
- Multinomial Logistic Regression
- Decision tree for classification
- Decision tree for regression
   
And the following notebooks on data preprocessing:   

- Image preprocessing
- Preprocessing a numerical/categorical dataset

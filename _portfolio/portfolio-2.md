I started this project when preparing for interviews and applying for different internships and residency programs. 

The project includes implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in plain Python (Python Version 3.6+). All algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries. The intention of these notebooks is to provide a basic understanding of the algorithms and their underlying structure

The full project description and code can be found on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/zotroneneis/ml_basics).

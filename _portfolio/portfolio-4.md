This project is similar to the "machine learning basics" project. It contains jupyter notebooks implementing several deep learning models using TensorFlow. Each notebook contains detailed explanations about each model, hopefully making it easy to understand all steps.
   
The notebooks run in Python 3.6, Tensorflow 1.8
   
Currently, the repo includes the following models:   
- Basic Variational Autoencoder
- Improved Variational Autoencoder
- Recurrent Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Network
   
The full project description and code can be found on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/zotroneneis/tensorflow_deep_learning_models).

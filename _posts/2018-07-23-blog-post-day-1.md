**Topics:** object oriented programming, classes, inheritance

I want to start with using some of the things I learned from the "Python Tricks" book (see my reading list for more details on the book). Therefore, I will start creating a little Magical Universe with classes and methods related to the [Tales of Castle Kilmere](http://alpopkes.com/posts/2018/07/the_tales_of_castle_kilmere/).

So let's start with the most important basics.

## What is Object Oriented Programming ?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a specific programming paradigm. In OOP computer programs are designed by creating *objects* that interact with each other. Each object can contain:    
a) attributes    
b) behavior in the form of methods      
     
Most OOP programming languages, including Python, are *class-based*. This means that objects are instances of *classes*. This might sound quite abstract. But when you think about it, this is exactly how our world looks like. We have lots of classes and instances of these classes. For example, we have the class "Person" and lots of individual persons (like you and me) that are *instances* of the "Person" class. An attribute of the "Person" class might be "name" or "birthdate". A method might be `calc_current_age` that computes the current age of the person.   
    
That's what I like about OOP: it reflects the structure of our world quite closely. This makes it easier to understand the concept.

## Classes in Python

A class acts as a *blueprint* for an object. It describes how objects (i.e. members) of a class are structured, what attributes an object of the class has and what methods / functionality. The syntax for creating an empty class is quite simple:

```python
class CastleKilmereMember:
    pass
```

Side note: `pass` is a Python keyword that can be used as a placeholder. It can be used to denote places where we will eventually put code. In this case, it allows us to run the code above without getting an error.

## Creating class objects

To create an actual object, that is, an *instance* of the class we need to *instantiate* the class. This is also simple:

```python
kilmere_member = CastleKilmereMember()
```

## Adding attributes and methods

So far our `CastleKilmereMember```` class is boring. We need to add some attributes and methods to make it more interesting.

```python
class CastleKilmereMember:
    """
    Creates a member of the Castle Kilmere School of Magic 
    """

    def __init__(self, name, birthyear, sex):
        self.name = name
        self.birthyear = birthyear
        self.sex = sex
        
    def says(self, words):
        return f"{self.name} says {words}"

bromley = CastleKilmereMember('Bromley Huckabee', 1959, 'male')
print(bromley.says("Hello!"))
```

This class has a method called `__init__`. The dunder init method (dunder = double underscore) is called whenever you create a new instance of the class. So when calling `bromley = CastleKilmereMember('Bromley Huckabee', 1959, 'male')` the `__init__` method of the `CastleKilmereMember` class is called with the arguments `'Bromley Huckabee', 1959, 'male'` which represent the name, birthyear and sex of the Castle Kilmere member. The `__init__` method returns an instance of the class which is then assigned to a variable called "bromley".
   
Note: The first argument of the `__init__` method is called 'self'. This argument will be the first argument in most methods. It points towards an instance of the class whenever the method is called. For more details on this, see the [blog post of day 4]() or the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html).   
   
We also added a method called `says` that adds behavior to our class. In this case, it allows our Castle Kilmere member to say something.

## Inheritance

The `CastleKilmereMember` class is nice, but of course we want many other classes in our Magical Universe. For example, we want to create pupils, professors, ghosts, etc. But all of these are members of Castle Kilmere, right? This is what *inheritance* is used for.   
   
Inheritance allows us to create a new class that *inherits* all attributes and methods from the *parent class*. The resulting *child class* can override methods and attributes of the parent class and it can add new functionality. Inheritance is great for reducing duplicated code and for showing the semantic relations between objects. Let's use the concept of inheritance to create a `Pupil` class! 

```python
class Pupil(CastleKilmereMember):
    """ Create a Castle Kilmere Pupil """

    def __init__(self, name, birthyear, sex, start_year, pet=None):
        super().__init__(name, birthyear, sex)
        self.start_year = start_year

        if pet is not None:
            self.pet_name, self.pet_type = pet

        self._elms = {
                  'Critical Thinking': False,
                  'Self-Defense Against Fresh Fruit': False,
                  'Broomstick Flying': False,
                  'Magical Theory': False,
                  'Foreign Magical Systems': False,
                  'Charms': False,
                  'Defence Against Dark Magic': False,
                  'History of Magic': False,
                  'Potions': False,
                  'Transfiguration': False}

luke = Pupil(name='Luke Bery',
              birthyear=2008,
              sex='male',
              start_year=2020,
              pet=('Cotton', 'owl'))
```

This new class inheritcs from out `CastleKilmereMember` class. In its `init` method we use the method `super` to call the `init` method of the parent class. Then, we add new attributes to the class. These attributes will be specific to object instances of the `Pupil` class. A pupil has more attributes than a simple Castle Kilmere member. For example, a pupil started school in a specific year. Also, a pupil might own a pet. Furthermore, we added an attribute "elms". This attribute will be used later. It contains all the classes a pupil might take. When creating a new pupil, she won't have passed any ELM (Elementary Level of Magic) yet. But this might change once she writes her first exams!


## Instance and class attributes

A Python object can have two types of attributes:     
a) Instance attributes    
b) Class attributes    

All the attributes in the examples above are *instance attributes*:    
- Instance attributes are tied to a particular object instance
- The contents of an instance variable (e.g. the actual name of a Castle Kilmere member) are stored on the instance itself, not on the class. For example, the content of the *name* attribute of the instance *bromley* is *Bromley Huckabee*. Other instances of the `CastleKilmereMember` class will have different names.   
- So the contents of an instance variable are independent from one object to the next!   
- When you modify the contents of an instance variable it will only affect the particular object instance, not any of the other objects

A *class attribute* is created inside the class definition. Let's add a class attribute to the `CastleKilmereMember` class

```python
class CastleKilmereMember:
    """ Creates a member of the Castle Kilmere School of Magic """
    
    # class attribute
    location = "United Kingdom"

    def __init__(self, name, birthyear, sex):
        ...

```

Class attributes:   
- Are not tied to any particular instance of the class   
- Instead, all instance of the class share access to the same set of class variables   
- When you modify a class variable, all instances of the class will be affected at the same time. 

We can access and modify class attributes both with and without an instance of the class:

```python
bromley = CastleKilmereMember('Bromley Huckabee', 1959, 'male')
print(bromley.location)
>>> United Kingdom
print(CastleKilmereMember.location)
>>> United Kingdom
```

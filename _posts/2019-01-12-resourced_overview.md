**Topics:** Learning Resources

Over the past two years I've come across several great resources for learning. Not only Python, but also Math, Machine Learning and other concepts. However, I never created a proper overview. So that's what this blog post is about. I will continue to add resources as I come across them and update broken links if necessary.

## Math
I'm always working on my math skills and I prefer the MIT classes for that. Although it takes time to work through an entire course I believe that it's worth it. Especially with math. 
- MIT Course: [Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/). This class is about differentiation and integration of functions of one variable. It teaches a lot of important concepts fundamental to many scientific disciplines.
- MIT Course: [Multivariate Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/). This class is part two of the calculus series. It's next on my list!
- MIT Course: [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/). This class covers matrix theory and linear algebra. Especially the part about matrix theory is very useful for anyone working with machine learning algorithms.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives). Math problems to solve for fun. Also perfect to practice programming!


## Machine Learning

### Books
- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf). This book gives a thorough overview of many machine learning concepts. But be aware: it gets quite complex and is math-heavy. Also note, that is gives a more probabilistic view of machine learning.

### Courses
- Tutorial: [Machine Learning Basics](https://github.com/zotroneneis/machine_learning_basics). I created this resource myself and I think it's very useful when learning about machine learning. The repository contains plain Python implementations of many basic machine learning algorithms.
- [Berkeley: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa18/). I haven't done this course yet but it looks really good. All videos can be found in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7k0r4t5c108AZRwfW-FhnkZ0sCKBChLH).

### Blogs
- [Machine Learning Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&t=week). I use this as a resource to keep up to date with the current advancements and developments. The link provides access to the top posts of each week (which is my favorite way of using this subreddit).
- [Google AI Blog](https://ai.googleblog.com/)
- [Open AI Blog](https://blog.openai.com/)

### Deep Learning
- Book: [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). 


## Python
- Book: [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). In my opinion, this is one of the best books to start with when learning Python. And it's available online for free! 
- [Learn Python Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/)
- [Index of Learn Python Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index). Great overview of Python Learning Resources.
- Tutorials: [Magical Universe](https://github.com/zotroneneis/magical_universe). This is one of my own resources. It looks into advanced Python features using the world of magig.
- Tutorials: [RealPython](https://realpython.com/). Dan Bader's website contains a ton of 
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives). Math problems to solve for fun. Also perfect to practice programming! Python solutions to all problems can be found very easily. I've started working on Project Euler a while back. My solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/zotroneneis/ProjectEuler).

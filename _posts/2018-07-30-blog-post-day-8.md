**Topics:** Adding new classes and methods to the Magical Universe

Today I used some of the concepts introduced during the last days to extend my Magical Universe. Specifically:

- I added a classmethod for creating the ghost 'the mocking knight'
- I added a 'friends' attribute to the ```Pupil``` class   
- I added methods for adding and listing all current friends of a Pupil
- I implemented a new 'Charm' class that allows to create charms
- I added two classmethods for creating popular charms

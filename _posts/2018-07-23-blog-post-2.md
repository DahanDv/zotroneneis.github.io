I want to start with using some of the stuff I learned from the "Python Tricks" book. Therefore, I will start creating a little 'Harry Potter universe' with classes and methods related to the Harry Potter world (I LOVE Harry Potter). Today my code includes the following concepts:   
- Object orientation / two classes: HogwartsMember, Pupil
- I used inheritance for the pupil class
- I used the @property decorator
- I created a static class method
- I used function annotations (Python 3 feature)

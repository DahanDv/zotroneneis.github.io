Hi! My name is Anna-Lena. Welcome to my personal website! I am currently working at **Microsoft Research** in Cambridge, UK, being one of the first participants in the [Microsoft AI Residency Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/microsoft-ai-residency-program/).

News
=====
**2018-11-16:** I was invited to be a guest on "Talk Python To Me", the biggest Python podcast! Check out the [new episode](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/186/100-days-of-python-in-a-magical-universe).

**2018-09-17:** I started my AI residency at the [Microsoft Research Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) in Cambridge, UK!

**2018-08-15:** My [magical universe project](https://github.com/zotroneneis/magical_universe) was mentioned on the Python Bytes podcast! Check out the episode [here](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/91/will-there-be-a-pyblazor).    

My interests 
=====
I am especially interested in     
a) The application of machine learning algorithms in health care   
b) Understanding how humans learn and how we can optimize human learning and productivity    
c) The functioning of the human brain and how machine learning can be applied in cognitive science research       

In my free time I enjoy kickboxing, improving my productivity, [reading](http://alpopkes.com/reading_list/) and meditating.

My path to machine learning
======

My enthusiasm for machine learning arose from my fascination for the human brain. I have been fascinated by the complexity of the human brain for most of my life. Consequently, I decided to study cognitive science in Osnabrück, Germany. After attending a machine learning class in my fourth semester I discovered my true passion: The study and delevopment of algorithms that can learn on their own, developing a sense of intelligence.

From that point on, all my efforts have been directed towards learning as much about machine learning as possible. I continued my studies with a graduate computer science program at Bonn, Germany and started a job as a research assistant in machine learning in my second semester of the graduate program. Since my graduation I have been working as a deep learning intern at Bosch, Palo Alto, California.
 
I am still amazed by the functioning of machine and deep learning techniques and how much they have made possible in the last years (including self-driving cars, computer assisted technology, speech recognition, etc.). I'm curious what new findings and applications the next years will bring and I am super excited to be a part of this.
<!-- First, I focused on the neuroscientific subjects of the program. However, after visiting a machine learning class in my fourth semester and spending a semester abroad at the Gaab Lab, a neuroscience laboratory at Harvard University, USA, I realized that neuroscience wasn’t the field of study I wanted to pursue. The machine learning class was eye-opening. Algorithms that can learn on their own, developing a sense of intelligence. How cool is that?! Especially neural networks attracted my attention as they are inspired by the functioning of the human brain. -->   
   
<!-- from that point on, all my efforts have been directed towards learning as much about machine learning as possible. Over the past two and a half years I have gained extensive experience studying machine learning and deep learning models, as well as applying them in a variety of contexts. I am fluent in Python, deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras and I have worked with various machine learning libraries. My excellent grades testify that I have a deep interest in the field and that I like to take on new challenges. Furthermore, my background in cognitive science gives me a unique view on research questions. Different to other STEM students I have attended courses on topics like philosophy of mind, cognitive neuropsychology or neurobiology. The acquired knowledge about the human brain and mind enables me to quickly identify parallels between concepts from AI (like reinforcement learning or neural networks), and their counterparts in cognitive science (psychology and neurobiology, respectively). Also, my efforts and deep interest have spread to my free time. For example, three months ago I have started working on courses at MIT OpenCourseWare to refresh and improve my mathematical skills. Since then, I have happily spent each Sunday working through lectures and recitations on calculus and linear algebra. -->

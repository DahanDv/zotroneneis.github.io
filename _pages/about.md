Hi! My name is Anna-Lena. Welcome to my personal website! I am currently working as a deep learning intern at Robert Bosch in Palo Alto, CA, USA. Starting September 2018 I will be one of the first residents of the Microsoft AI Residency Program in Cambridge, UK.

My path to machine learning
======

My enthusiasm for machine learning arose from my fascination for the human brain. I have been fascinated by the complexity of the human brain for most of my life. Consequently, I decided to study cognitive science in Osnabrück, Germany. First, I focused on the neuroscientific subjects of the program. However, after visiting a machine learning class in my fourth semester and spending a semester abroad at the Gaab Lab, a neuroscience laboratory at Harvard University, USA, I realized that neuroscience wasn’t the field of study I wanted to pursue. The machine learning class was eye-opening. Algorithms that can learn on their own, developing a sense of intelligence. How cool is that?! Especially neural networks attracted my attention as they are inspired by the functioning of the human brain.   
   
From that point on, all my efforts have been directed towards learning as much about machine learning as possible. Over the past two and a half years I have gained extensive experience studying machine learning and deep learning models, as well as applying them in a variety of contexts. I am fluent in Python, deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras and I have worked with various machine learning libraries. My excellent grades testify that I have a deep interest in the field and that I like to take on new challenges. Furthermore, my background in cognitive science gives me a unique view on research questions. Different to other STEM students I have attended courses on topics like philosophy of mind, cognitive neuropsychology or neurobiology. The acquired knowledge about the human brain and mind enables me to quickly identify parallels between concepts from AI (like reinforcement learning or neural networks), and their counterparts in cognitive science (psychology and neurobiology, respectively). Also, my efforts and deep interest have spread to my free time. For example, three months ago I have started working on courses at MIT OpenCourseWare to refresh and improve my mathematical skills. Since then, I have happily spent each Sunday working through lectures and recitations on calculus and linear algebra.

I am still amazed by the functioning of machine and deep learning techniques and how much they have made possible in the last years (including self-driving cars, computer assisted technology, speech recognition, etc.). I'm curious what new findings and applications the next years will bring and I am super excited to be a part of this.

Motivation When I started with Python and created my first package I was confused. Creating and managing a package seemed much harder than I expected. In addition, multiple tools existed and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure which one to use. I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you had the very same problem in the past. Python has a zillion tools to manage virtual environments and create packages and it can be hard (or almost impossible) to understand which one fits your needs.</description></item><item><title>Mocking in Python</title><link>https://alpopkes.com/posts/python/mocking/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alpopkes.com/posts/python/mocking/</guid><description>Topics: Mocking in Python
Today, I want to talk about mocking. I became interested in this topic a few months back when I started to work in a data engineering project at work. In this project we have a lot of tests that relies on mocking to test code with external dependencies. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like reading long blog posts, consider listening to one of the podcast episodes I did on this topic: there is one at Talk Python to Me and the other at Test and Code.</description></item></channel></rss>

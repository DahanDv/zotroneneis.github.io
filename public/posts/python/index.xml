      <description>Topics: Mocking in Python
Today, I want to talk about mocking. I became interested in this topic a few months back when I started to work in a data engineering project at work. In this project we have a lot of tests that relies on mocking to test code with external dependencies. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like reading long blog posts, consider listening to one of the podcast episodes I did on this topic: there is one at Talk Python to Me and the other at Test and Code.</description>
